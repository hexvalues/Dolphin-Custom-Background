NOTE: This was a theme I just made for myself and what style I like, but most of it is just vanilla so figured most ppl could use it since it's super easy
to replace the background image. I might update it in the future with better design.

1. If you are on 5.0-16393 or above, make sure the image you wanna use is a PNG, from my testing only those work since dolphin switched to Qt6.
However if you are on an older version, any image format should work.

2. Navigate to your dolphin's "Styles" folder and put the "Meow.qss" file in there, this is usually in Users > username > AppData > Roaming > Dolphin Emulator > Styles

3. Open the qss file in a text editor and replace PATH_TO_YOUR_IMAGE with the file directory of your image. (This is in line 11)
Make sure to not accidently remove the quotation marks, parentheses, etc.
Make sure to replace any back slashes "\" in the path with forward slashes "/"

**OPTIONAL**
4. If the text looks off because of the image background, replace the first color code with one that matches (This is i line 5)
